## Mission Statement

To democratize real estate technology by providing every agent, buyer, seller, and service professional with a transparent, blockchain-verified platform that builds trust at every step of the transaction — making real estate simpler, safer, and more accessible for everyone.

---

## Vision

A world where every real estate transaction is transparent, verifiable, and built on trust — powered by blockchain technology that protects every party at the table.

---

## Company Overview

**Company Name:** DarkWave Studios LLC
**Product:** TrustHome
**Industry:** Real Estate Technology (PropTech)
**Business Model:** White-label SaaS platform for real estate agents and brokerages
**Woman-Owned Business:** Yes (WOSB-eligible)

---

## Ownership Structure

| Partner | Ownership | Role |
|---------|-----------|------|
| Jennifer Lambert | 51% | Managing Member, Industry Liaison, Business Development |
| [Founder] | 49% | Technical Lead, Platform Architect, Product Development |

**Woman-Owned Business Designation:** With Jennifer Lambert holding 51% ownership, TrustHome qualifies as a Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), eligible for WBENC certification. This designation opens doors to government contracts, corporate supplier diversity programs, and specialized funding opportunities.

---

## The Problem

Real estate transactions involve 8-12+ parties (agents, buyers, sellers, inspectors, lenders, title companies, appraisers, contractors) using disconnected tools. This creates:

- **Fragmented communication** across email, text, phone, and multiple apps
- **Lack of transparency** — clients don't know what's happening or what comes next
- **Trust gaps** — no way to verify professional credentials, certifications, or track records
- **Inefficient workflows** — agents juggle 5-10 separate tools for CRM, marketing, showings, documents
- **No universal record** — transaction history is scattered and unverifiable

---

## The Solution

TrustHome is a unified platform that brings all transaction parties into a single, blockchain-verified environment:

1. **One Hub for Everyone:** Agents, clients, inspectors, lenders, title companies, and contractors all access the same transaction from their personalized portal.

2. **Blockchain-Verified Trust:** Every credential, document, and milestone is stamped on the DarkWave Trust Layer (DWTL) blockchain — creating an immutable, verifiable record.

3. **White-Label Ready:** Brokerages can brand TrustHome as their own, offering clients a premium, tech-forward experience.

4. **AI-Powered Efficiency:** Automated lead scoring, marketing content generation, smart follow-ups, and predictive analytics reduce agent workload by 40%+.

5. **Ecosystem Integration:** Connects to existing business tools (CRM, marketing, chat, analytics) through the PaintPros.io backend — no data silos.
