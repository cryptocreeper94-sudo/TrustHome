# TrustHome — Executive Summary

**Date:** February 9, 2026
**Company:** DarkWave Studios LLC
**Product:** TrustHome — Blockchain-Verified Real Estate Platform

---

## Mission

To democratize real estate technology by providing every agent, buyer, seller, and service professional with a transparent, blockchain-verified platform that builds trust at every step of the transaction.

---

## What We Do

TrustHome is a white-label SaaS platform that unifies every party in a real estate transaction — agents, clients, inspectors, lenders, title companies, appraisers, and contractors — into a single, blockchain-verified hub. Every credential, document, and milestone is stamped on the DarkWave Trust Layer blockchain, creating an immutable record of trust.

---

## The Problem

Real estate transactions are fragmented. Agents use 5-10 disconnected tools. Clients are left in the dark. Service providers have no centralized way to collaborate. Professional credentials are unverifiable. There is no single source of truth.

## The Solution

TrustHome brings everyone to one table with:
- **Unified Transaction Hub** — all parties, one platform
- **Blockchain Trust Scores** — verifiable professional credentials (dwtl.io)
- **AI-Powered Tools** — automated marketing, lead scoring, smart follow-ups
- **White-Label Ready** — brokerages deploy under their own brand
- **Trust Layer Membership** — every subscriber gets a blockchain-verified professional identity
